# Priorities Implementation - Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Priority 1, Priority 2, and Priority 3.3 as requested.

---

## Priority 1: Department Head System ✅

### Database Changes ([prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma))

#### 1. Added `isDepartmentHead` field to User model (line 67)
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  isDepartmentHead Boolean @default(false) // Is this teacher a Head of Department (HOD)?
}
```

#### 2. Created `DepartmentHeadAssignment` model (lines 987-1009)
```prisma
model DepartmentHeadAssignment {
  id             String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId         String
  department     String // Sciences, Languages, Humanities, Technology, Arts, Physical Education
  academicYearId String
  assignedAt     DateTime @default(now())
  assignedBy     String?
  isActive       Boolean  @default(true)
  endedAt        DateTime?
  version        Int      @default(0)
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt

  user         User         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)
  academicYear AcademicYear @relation(fields: [academicYearId], references: [id], onDelete: Restrict)

  @@unique([department, academicYearId, isActive])
  @@index([userId])
  @@index([department])
  @@index([academicYearId])
  @@index([isActive])
  @@map("department_head_assignments")
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ One HOD per department per academic year (enforced by unique constraint)
- ✅ Tracks assignment history
- ✅ Supports HOD rotation between years
- ✅ Records who assigned the HOD (assignedBy)
- ✅ Can end assignments (endedAt)

### Benefits:
- **Distributed Leadership:** Each department has a dedicated head
- **Clear Accountability:** HOD responsible for department outcomes
- **Reduced Admin Load:** HOD handles department-level decisions
- **Subject Expertise:** Department managed by subject specialist

## Priority 2: Enhanced Notifications System ✅

### Database Changes ([prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma))

#### Updated `NotificationType` enum (lines 1061-1076)
```prisma
enum NotificationType {
  // Existing types
  GRADE_POSTED
  REPORT_READY
  ATTENDANCE_ALERT
  ANNOUNCEMENT
  SYSTEM_UPDATE
  ASSIGNMENT_DUE
  PARENT_MEETING
  FEE_REMINDER
  DISCIPLINARY_ACTION

  // NEW: Department & Assessment notifications
  ASSESSMENT_CREATED     // Admin created new assessment
